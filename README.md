Changelog - I have set improvements in mind, but please let me know how else to improve P3!

V1.0.0 | 5.15.17 - Fresh from this laptop. Note: diameter of node width determined by (times X was aedile)+(times X was duumvir)+(times X was quinquennial)+(times X rogator for one person * 0.5)+(times X was a priest)+(times X was a flamen*2).  

What is P3?

When I took a class on ancient Pompeii this year, I found myself drawn to programmata, prosography and the complex yet different web of interaction between aristocrats in this city, so basically the main matter James L. Franklin has been researching. This is a visualization of my/others’ findings so far and I aim to expand this as I find more information and see what I can deduct from this.

The code base for this was made for a simple GUI lab by my CSC 212 professor, represented by P3 and the PointCanvas class. From there, I wrote Profile as a node class and Linum (pl. Lina) as an edge class to be used in constructing these graphs with PointCanvas as a class that could work with Profiles and Lina to paint a graph displayable in P3. 

How do I operate P3?

> Compile all Java classes in the command line.
> Run P3.java.

- Click Political Ties or Religious Ties to view graphs.
- Click Info Mode, and now you can click on any node to see who that represents. This state does not carry over between switching graphs.

Findings(based on my pool)

- Diversity is prevalent among both graphs, particularly well-distributed with the political ties graph.
- Tag-teams of one or two pairs of magistrates were a common strategy, as represented by the x-box structures. Adversarial X-boxes are also common.
- All three Romans in the political graph are in two adversarial relationships.
- Most aristocrats pledge allegiance to one religion, sometimes two if especially ambitious.
- Popularity ranking: Ceres (7 supporters), Augustus (6), Flamen (5), Isis (4), Venus and Neptune (1 each)
